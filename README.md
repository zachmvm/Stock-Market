# Stock-Market


Designed a website allowing new/existing users to buy and sell stocks as well as manage stock portfolio. 
Made possible by querying IEX for real time data on stock prices. Requiring the use of an API KEY to return data, 
website also has the feature to quote stocks, and add cash into exisiting accounts as well as view a current portfolio with available cash.
